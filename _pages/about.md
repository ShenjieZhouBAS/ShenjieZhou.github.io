About me
==================
I am a physical oceanographer by day working at [British Antarctic Survey (BAS)](https://www.bas.ac.uk/) located in west Cambridge in the UK. I joined BAS since 2020 after finishing my doctoral training in physical oceanography focusing on oceanice response to the stochastic atmospheric forcing in University of East Anglia. My research concerns about the changes of ocean and its role in modulating our climate systems. I am not a strictly sea-going oceanographer, but I tend to tackle problems using wide range of observational dataset collected by ship, floats, and even data measured by tagged seals, they are way more helpful with data collection than initially expected. I am interested in subpolar gyre dynamics, particular in the Weddell Sea, the Antarctic Bottom Water formation changes and its consequence on the global ocean circulation. I am also trying to understand the recent Antarcitic sea ice loss and potentially a regime shift after the long opposing increasing trend compared to the Arctic sea ice loss since 2016. I am now part of [OCEAN:ICE project](https://ocean-ice.eu/) and previously with [SO-CHIC](https://www.sochic-h2020.eu/). See [here](https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/shezhou/#projects) for other projects that I was involved in.
 
By night, I pay my tribute to our new family members - two maine coons, Cumulus and Nimbus (previously known as Jeff and Ralph). In my spare time, I also go running, cycling, paddle boarding, bouldering and verying occassional pubbing.
